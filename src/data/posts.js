# The Future of Web Development

Web development is evolving at a breakneck pace. In this post, we'll explore some of the most exciting trends shaping the industry.

## AI-Assisted Coding
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are changing how we write code. They're not replacing developers, but making them more productive.

## Meta-Frameworks
Next.js, Remix, and SvelteKit are becoming the standard for building robust web applications, offering features like server-side rendering and static site generation out of the box.

## WebAssembly
Wasm is unlocking new possibilities for running high-performance code in the browser, enabling applications like video editors and 3D games to run natively on the web.

# Why UI/UX Matters

A pretty interface is nice, but a usable one is essential.

## User-Centered Design
Always start with the user. What are their goals? What are their pain points?

## Accessibility
Building accessible websites ensures that everyone, regardless of ability, can use your product. It's not just a nice-to-have; it's a necessity.
